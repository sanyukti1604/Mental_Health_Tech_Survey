# Mental_Health_Tech_Survey
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a mental health survey conducted among tech professionals. The objective is to identify trends, understand how workplace culture affects mental health, and uncover key insights that can help promote healthier and more inclusive work environments.

Project Objectives
Understand how factors like remote work, employer support, and work interference impact mental health.

Analyze demographic patterns related to treatment-seeking behavior.

Explore stigma and fear associated with disclosing mental health conditions at work.

Highlight actionable insights for tech companies to build mental-health-friendly policies.

Visualize survey responses to derive patterns and trends effectively.

Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas – for data wrangling and transformation

Seaborn & Matplotlib – for creating impactful visualizations

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis includes responses from tech industry professionals on various factors such as:

Age, Gender, and Location

Current mental health status and treatment history

Employer's attitude and support for mental health

Remote work status and workplace interference

Stigma, consequences, and willingness to discuss mental health at work

Key Business Questions Answered
Does working remotely influence an individual's likelihood of seeking treatment?

Are employees comfortable discussing mental health issues at the workplace?

How does age relate to treatment-seeking behavior?

Do tech employees fear negative consequences of disclosing mental health issues?

Does employer support reduce mental health interference with work?

Key Visual Insights
Many employees hesitate to disclose mental health issues due to fear of consequences.

Remote work flexibility is linked to a higher likelihood of seeking treatment.

Most respondents who report work interference also report receiving little employer support.

Younger employees are more open to treatment than older ones, showing a generational shift.

Tech company culture plays a role in how employees address mental health concerns.

Conclusion
This project helped develop my skills in data exploration, visualization, and translating survey data into meaningful insights. It emphasizes the importance of fostering a supportive environment in tech workplaces to address mental health proactively. These insights can guide companies in making evidence-based improvements in policies, work culture, and employee well-being initiatives.
